# Time Complexity

Time complexity is a computational concept that helps us understand the efficiency of algorithms. It is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to process as a function of the size of the input data.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm.

Common time complexities include:
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time

Problem Description:

Write a program that returns the product of all elements present in the array.

Note: The list with elements is already passed as an argument to the function. User don't need to take any input. Just perform the task on the passed arguments and return the required result.

Constraints:

1 <= |A| <= 100
1 <= A <= 100
Note: It is guaranteed that the resultant product will be <= 1015
Input Format:

An integer array **A** as the function argument.
Output Format:

Product of elements in integer format
Sample Input:

A = [7, 9, 2, 51]
Sample Output:

6426
Sample explanation:

The product of all the elements is 7 * 9 * 2 * 51 = 6426 is returned.
